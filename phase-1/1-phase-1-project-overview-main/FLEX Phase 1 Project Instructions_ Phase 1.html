<h2>ðŸŽ¯Phase 1 Project Overview</h2>
<p>After completing Topics 1-10, you should be all set to tackle the <a title="Phase 1 Project" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/g0cb5a456607af875b612a7ad8abd6317" data-api-endpoint="https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/4339/assignments/133276" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Phase 1 Project!</a>

    <a title="Phase 1 Project" href="$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/g0cb5a456607af875b612a7ad8abd6317" data-api-endpoint="https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/4339/assignments/133276" data-api-returntype="Assignment"></a>
</p>
<p>The Phase 1 Project is your first start-to-finish task where you have a lot of freedom in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the data you use,</li>
    <li>the questions you ask, and</li>
    <li>the way you answer those questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the project should take 20-40 hours to complete. To stay on pace, you should aim to complete the project in the following # of weeks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>20-week pace: 1 week&nbsp;</li>
    <li>40-week pace: 2 weeks</li>
    <li>60-week pace: 3-4 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>Your assigned One-on-One lead can help you find out exactly how many days you should spend on your end-of-phase project using the Flex Cadence and Milestones Calendar - please ask if you need help planning your project time!</p>
<p>At the end of the project, you will have a live Project Review session<strong> <em>with an instructor who is not your One-on-One Lead!</em> </strong>Passing that review is how you progress to the next Phase, and you are required to pass all Phase Project Reviews in numerical order to complete the course.</p>
<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<p>The project requirements are spelled out in both:</p>

    </li>
</ol>
<p>In brief, the major 3 deliverables include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A jupyter notebook with your technical analysis</li>
    <li>A 5-10 minute non-technical executive summary presentation</li>
    <li>A GitHub repository that contains:
        <ul>
            <li>the .ipynb notebook file</li>
            <li>the .pdf of your presentation</li>
            <li>a README summarizing your results</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<p>When you're ready to begin the project, we recommend you do three things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Message your One-on-One Lead on Slack and indicate you've begun the project</li>
    <li>Create your GitHub repository where you can save all of your work</li>
    <li>Schedule a Project Review session&nbsp;<strong><em>with an instructor other than your One-on-One Lead</em></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Note: you are <strong>allowed to continue to refine and update your project/repo up until 24 hours before your review,</strong> at which point the submitted materials will be considered final.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Submitting Your Project on Canvas</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You will turn in your project materials on 2 Canvas assignments:&nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>The GitHub Repo Link is uploaded here:
                <ul>

<h3>Scheduling Your Review</h3>
<p>Schedule your review using the Phase 1 Project Booking Page (<a href="https://go.oncehub.com/ODSPhase1ProjectReviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://go.oncehub.com/ODSPhase1ProjectReviews)</a>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>First, confirm your auto-detected time zone and then select Continue

<h2>
    <span>Project Review Format</span>
</h2>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1">
        <span>First, you will talk through your </span><strong>5-8 minute, non-technical presentation</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li aria-level="2">
            <span>The reviewing instructor will ask you a question or two as if they were your target audience</span>
        </li>
        <li aria-level="2">
            <span>The reviewing instructor will then discuss any feedback or action items for the presentation</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li aria-level="1">
        <span>Next, you will go through your </span><strong>technical notebook&nbsp;</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li aria-level="2">
            <span>Please have the notebook open and pre-run before your review (if possible)</span>
        </li>
        <li aria-level="2">
            <span>Depending on which project it is, the reviewing instructor will focus on a few areas of the notebook and generally will NOT have you talk through 100% of it</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li aria-level="1">
        <span>After reviewing the notebook and presentation, the reviewing instructor will submit feedback based on the rubric in Canvas (with the changes requested, if relevant)</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span>With all that in mind - go forth and create the first big ticket item for your data science portfolio, we can't wait to see it!</span>
