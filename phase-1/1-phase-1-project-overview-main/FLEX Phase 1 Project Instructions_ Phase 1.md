ðŸŽ¯Phase 1 Project Overview
-------------------------


After completing Topics 1-10, you should be all set to tackle the [Phase 1 Project!]($CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/g0cb5a456607af875b612a7ad8abd6317 "Phase 1 Project")








The Phase 1 Project is your first start-to-finish task where you have a lot of freedom in:


* the data you use,
* the questions you ask, and
* the way you answer those questions.


Overall the project should take 20-40 hours to complete. To stay on pace, you should aim to complete the project in the following # of weeks:


* 20-week pace: 1 week
* 40-week pace: 2 weeks
* 60-week pace: 3-4 weeks


Your assigned One-on-One lead can help you find out exactly how many days you should spend on your end-of-phase project using the Flex Cadence and Milestones Calendar - please ask if you need help planning your project time!


At the end of the project, you will have a live Project Review session ***with an instructor who is not your One-on-One Lead!*** Passing that review is how you progress to the next Phase, and you are required to pass all Phase Project Reviews in numerical order to complete the course.


Project Requirements
--------------------


The project requirements are spelled out in both:


1. the rubric attached to the [Phase 1 Project]($CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/g0cb5a456607af875b612a7ad8abd6317 "Phase 1 Project")
2. the [Phase 1 Project Submission Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFN9zle3-18Mtq2doEjMr3aUx2wCVySlQXzWuZiv_EY/edit)


In brief, the major 3 deliverables include:


* A jupyter notebook with your technical analysis
* A 5-10 minute non-technical executive summary presentation
* A GitHub repository that contains:
	+ the .ipynb notebook file
	+ the .pdf of your presentation
	+ a README summarizing your results


Getting Started:
----------------


When you're ready to begin the project, we recommend you do three things:


1. Message your One-on-One Lead on Slack and indicate you've begun the project
2. Create your GitHub repository where you can save all of your work
3. Schedule a Project Review sessionÂ ***with an instructor other than your One-on-One Lead***
	* Note: you are **allowed to continue to refine and update your project/repo up until 24 hours before your review,** at which point the submitted materials will be considered final.


Submitting Your Project on Canvas
---------------------------------


* You will turn in your project materials on 2 Canvas assignments:
	+ The GitHub Repo Link is uploaded here:
		- [Phase 1 Project - GitHub Repository URL]($CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/modules/items/g90d922828171bfe0405beda96749f255 "Phase 1 Project - GitHub Repository URL")
	+ The PDF Exports of Your Notebook, Presentation, and README are uploaded here:
		- [Phase 1 Project]($CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE$/modules/items/g86f11f3fa9dd94154a506afb86f79b0b "Phase 1 Project")
* For additional instructions on submitting your project pdfs on canvas see:

### Scheduling Your Review


Schedule your review using the Phase 1 Project Booking Page ([https://go.oncehub.com/ODSPhase1ProjectReviews)](https://go.oncehub.com/ODSPhase1ProjectReviews)



1. First, confirm your auto-detected time zone and then select Continue
   

![Confirm your time zone.](./images/scheduling-example-1.png)
2. Then, on the calendar that appears, select a timeslot from the calendar
   

![Select a timeslot](./images/scheduling-example-2.png)

3. After selecting a time slot you should see a form requesting information about you and your project materials.Â **Please note the third line of the form, which indicates the Team Member that your appointment will be with. If the selected timeslot is with your assigned One-on-One Lead, then please select another timeslot.** 
**![Project scheduling form - check the Team Member field](./images/scheduling-example-3.png)**



Note: you are allowed to **continue to refine and update your project/repo up until 24 hours before your review**, at which point the submitted materials will be considered final.Â 




Project Review Format
----------------------


* First, you will talk through your **5-8 minute, non-technical presentation**
+ The reviewing instructor will ask you a question or two as if they were your target audience
+ The reviewing instructor will then discuss any feedback or action items for the presentation

* Next, you will go through your **technical notebook**
+ Please have the notebook open and pre-run before your review (if possible)
+ Depending on which project it is, the reviewing instructor will focus on a few areas of the notebook and generally will NOT have you talk through 100% of it

* After reviewing the notebook and presentation, the reviewing instructor will submit feedback based on the rubric in Canvas (with the changes requested, if relevant)


Â 



With all that in mind - go forth and create the first big ticket item for your data science portfolio, we can't wait to see it!
