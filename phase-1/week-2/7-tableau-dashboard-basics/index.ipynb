    "## Introduction\n",
    "Until now, we have been using Tableau workbooks to get familiar with the Tableau interface. Now we will take your Tableau skills one step further and dive into one of the most useful features of Tableau -- __dashboards__. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will describe the components of Tableau's dashboard workspace. Then, create a few vizzes and learn how to arrange and customize the dashboard to present our data. Next, we will then explore some of the interactive objects and see how they can be used to allow the viewer to ask questions of the data to gain insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "* Identify and describe dashboard Objects and other elements of a Tableau dashboard workspace\n",
    "* Use horizontal and vertical containers to create a layout to arrange vizzes and objects on the dashboard\n",
    "* Add interactive elements to a Tableau dashboard"
