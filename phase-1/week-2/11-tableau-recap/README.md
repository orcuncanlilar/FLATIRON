## Tableau - Recap
Over the last few modules, we have gone from zero to a dashboard with Tableau. Here is how we did it. 

* First, we described Tableau Public and demonstrated how to download it to our local machine.
* We identified the components of Tableau's Start page and located the Connect pane so that we could import our data. We also discovered resources available for free online, like the Super Store Sales dataset.
* Then, we used the Data Source page to connect to data sources. We explored how to build relationships between disparate data sources using the logical Canvas.
* Next, we explored the Tableau workspace. This enabled us to create our first worksheets, which we used to build out interactive visualizations. We discussed use cases for Tableau's most useful basic visualizations. 
* We combined the visualizations we created to build out a realistic dashboard and add some advanced features.
* Equipped with these skills, you applied your knowledge of Tableau with your analytical skills to your dashboard. 

In addition to your knowledge of the Tableau interface, you developed your awareness of foundational principles in dashboarding, such as:

* Selecting the right visualizations for your use case
* Combining visualizations to maximize communication
* Enhancing the informativeness of the dashboard with strategic annotations
