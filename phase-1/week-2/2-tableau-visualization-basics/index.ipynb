    "# Tableau - Useful Visualizations and the Show Me Pane\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Data visualizations are not one-size fits all so it is important to select a visualization that works for your data and the story that you want to tell with that data. Tableau can generate a diverse collection of __vizzes__ (Tableau's special word for visualizations) that you can customize for your use case. In this lesson, we will discuss __Measures__ and __Dimensions__ and how you should choose them to build a viz. Then, we discuss Show Me pane and highlight a few of the most essential visualizations - the Bar Chart, the Scatter Plot, and the Line Plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Identify the dimensions and measures needed to generate a viz\n",
    "* Apply a visualization to data using the Show Me Pane"

    "If we return to the Data Pane, you might notice that the names of the columns have two distinct colors, <font color='green'>__green__</font> and <font color='blue'>__blue__</font>. These colors help to distinguish between __Measures__ and __Dimensions__. These will be the building blocks of your visualizations.\n",

    "<b>Measures are continuous data points.</b> They contain the quantitative values that can be measured such as sales, height, and age. <br>\n",
    "<li>These values can be aggregated. When you add measure to your workspace Tableau automatically applies a default aggregation, which is usually sum.</li>\n",
    "<li>If you look just before the name of each measure, you will see a small icon. These icons represent data type and are automatically generated by Tableau.</li>\n",
    "<li>If the data type is not accurate or you just want to customize it, you can do so by hovering over the measure, and then clicking the arrow to open the options menu.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<h3><font color='blue'><b>Dimensions</b></font></h3>\n",
    "<b>Dimensions are categorical data points.</b> They contain qualitative values like month, state, and date.<br>\n",

We also discussed how to use the Show Me Pane to build visualizations from our measures and dimensions. In the upcoming lab, you will have an opportunity to build a visualization from start to finish using the SuperStore Sales data set. During that lab, you will need the skills we practiced here to select the appropriate visualization for your data and use case."
