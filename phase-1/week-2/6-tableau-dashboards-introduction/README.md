# Tableau Dashboards - Introduction

## Introduction
The most powerful feature of Tableau is the ability to create interactive dashboards. A Tableau dashboard is a collection of views that have been formatted to convey information from data with multiple visualizations. The creator of a dashboard can add interactive objects to the visualizations to allow the viewer to change the views to understand various features of the data. In this lesson, we will introduce Tableau dashboards and look at the various functionality Tableau offers to format dashboards for effective communication of the data for the viewer.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Explain use cases for a dashboard
* Explain the benefits of an interactive dashboard

## Why Create a Dashboard?
Up until this point, we have used Tableau workbooks to organize our worksheets which contain vizzes of particular views from our data source. This is a great start, but there is still room for improvement concerning the end-user experience. Flipping through tabs is not an efficient way to see the big picture from your data. We can level up the expression of our insights by creating a dashboard to aggregate our findings on related topics. Dashboards can be a useful tool for data scientists and analysts to present and communicate their findings in a visually appealing and accessible way. Here are some use cases for dashboards in data science/analysis:

These are some common uses cases for dashboards in the world of business intelligence:

1. Monitoring business performance: Dashboards can be used to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for a business, such as revenue, customer acquisition, and website traffic. This can help decision-makers quickly identify trends and areas that need improvement.

2. Exploring data: Dashboards can allow data scientists to interact with data in real time, enabling them to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

3. Communicating insights: Dashboards can be used to present insights and analysis to stakeholders in a clear and easy-to-understand way. This can help decision-makers make informed choices based on data.

4. Predictive analytics: Dashboards can be used to visualize predictive models, allowing users to see how the model is performing over time and make adjustments as needed.

5. Social media monitoring: Dashboards can be used to monitor social media channels in real-time, allowing businesses to quickly respond to customer feedback and complaints.

6. Financial analysis: Dashboards can be used to track financial metrics, such as sales and revenue, expenses, and profit margins. This can help businesses make data-driven decisions about investments, cost-cutting measures, and pricing strategies.

7. Healthcare analysis: Dashboards can be used to analyze patient data, such as demographics, medical history, and treatment outcomes. This can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care and treatment.

Overall, dashboards can be a powerful tool for data scientists and analysts to explore data, communicate insights, and make data-driven decisions.

## Interactive Dashboards
Adding interactivity to a dashboard is a great tool to let your viewer adjust the view of the data to meet their need. 

One way you can add interactivity to a dashboard is to have a drop-down menu of locations for the viewer to focus on. Upon selecting a location the vizes on the dashboard would automatically display the data relevant to that specific location. 

Check out the example below:

<div>
    <center>
<table><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
    </center> </div>

Interactive dashboards are good because they provide a more engaging and customizable user experience compared to static reports or charts. Here are some reasons why interactive dashboards are beneficial:

1. Customization: Interactive dashboards allow users to customize their view of the data, choosing which metrics and dimensions they want to see, and how the data is presented. This can make the data more relevant and meaningful to each user's needs.

2. Real-time updates: Interactive dashboards can be designed to update automatically in real-time as new data becomes available. This allows users to monitor key metrics and KPIs, and respond to changes in the data as they happen.

3. Drill-down capabilities: Interactive dashboards can allow users to drill down into the data to explore it at a more granular level. This can help users identify trends and outliers, and uncover insights that may not be visible at a high level.

4. Collaboration: Interactive dashboards can facilitate collaboration among teams by allowing multiple users to view and interact with the same data at the same time. This can promote data-driven decision-making and help teams stay aligned on goals and priorities.

5. User-friendly: Interactive dashboards are often designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the data. This can make the data more accessible to a broader range of users, including those who may not have a technical background.

Interactive dashboards add value because they provide users with more control over the data, allow for real-time updates, enable deeper exploration of the data, promote collaboration, and are user-friendly. These benefits can help users make more informed decisions and drive better outcomes.

## Summary
Tableau dashboards are a powerful tool for data scientists and analysts to present and communicate their findings in a visually appealing and accessible way. Dashboards can be used to monitor business performance, explore data, communicate insights, perform predictive analytics, monitor social media, track financial metrics, and analyze patient data. Interactive dashboards offer a more engaging and customizable user experience, providing users with more control over the data, real-time updates, deeper exploration, collaboration opportunities, and a user-friendly interface. 

Over the next few lessons, we will learn how to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau and explore ways that we can tweak the dashboard to improve the user experience.
