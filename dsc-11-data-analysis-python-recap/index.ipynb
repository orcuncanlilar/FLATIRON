These are variables \"in memory\". In many cases data scientists will want to work with larger data files that are saved after the code is finished running. This is data \"on disk\". Python has built-in functionality to facilitate communication between variables in memory and files on disk.\n", "\n", "Key takeaways:\n", "\n", "* Variables **in memory** are the current active variables in your code, which go away if you shut down the kernel or shut down your computer\n", "* Files **on disk** are the things you see printed out when you type `ls` in the terminal, which persist when you shut down the kernel or shut down your computer\n", "* There is no concept like \"editing\" when working with files in Python. You are either reading from the first line to the last line of the file (sometimes all at once), or writing lines one after another\n", "* In Python, the typical way to interact with these files is to use the `open` built-in function\n", "  * The first step is identifying the path to the file, which is a string and represents the relative path from the current code execution context to the location of the file on the computer. It is represented as `path_to_file` in the examples below\n", "  * To open a file for reading, that looks like:\n", "    ```python\n", "    with open(path_to_file) as f:\n", "        # Read data from file object f\n", "    ```\n", "  * To open a file for writing, that looks like:\n", "    ```python\n", "    with open(path_to_file, \"w\") as f:\n", "        # Write data to the file object f\n", "    ```\n", "  * The `with...:` syntax means that the file is automatically closed after the `with` block ends. If you use the syntax `f = open(path_to_file)` instead, you also need to call `f.close()` when you are finished working with the file\n", "  * You will find that some third-party libraries handle opening and closing the files for you. In this case, you only need to identify the file path and do not need to call `open` and `.close` yourself\n", "  * The `open` function assumes that you are working with a file encoded as plain text, such as an unstructured `.txt` file, CSV file, or JSON file. If you are working with a file encoded as bytes, such as a JPEG image, you need to specify a mode of `\"rb\"` to read or `\"wb\"` to write when you call `open`"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### CSV\n", "\n", "The CSV format stands for \"comma-separated values\".

The file names typically end with the extension `.csv`\n", "* CSV is a **plain text** format. This means that it is encoded as text that is readable without specialized software, and you can explore the contents using VS Code, Vim, or any other general-purpose editor\n", "* CSV is a **delimited** format. This means that there are characters in the text of the file that are intended to separate the pieces of data from one another\n", "  * As you might assume from the name, the most common delimiter is a comma. A line of comma-delimited CSV content representing four pieces of data might look like:\n", "    ```\n", "    10,2,1.5,\"Firstname Lastname\"\n", "    ```\n", "  * It is also possible to use some other delimiter. One of the most common is a tab `\\t`, to the extent that there is a name \"TSV\" (tab-separated values) for that specific kind of file. You could also use a pipe `|`, semicolon `;`, or really any other character as long as the markup is consistent and the code knows how to interpret it. Technically all of these files would still be referred to as CSVs, even though the delimiter is not a comma\n", "* In Python, we can use the `csv` module to parse data from CSV files ([documentation here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html))\n", "  * If the data file does not contain headings, the `csv.reader` function works well.

The file names typically end with the extension `.json`\n", "* JSON is a **plain text** format, like CSV\n", "* The markup of JSON is more complex than CSV.
